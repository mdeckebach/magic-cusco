INTRODUCTION
------------
With its pleasant climate and fertile land, the Sacred Valley was a key settlement area for the Incas. Located along a popular jungle travel route, it had access to fruit trees and tropical lowland plants that normally would not be available in the high country. 

The Sacred Valley has an altitude of 2,800 meters and combines the charm of beautiful landscapes with the history of important Incan archaeology.

DAY 1: SACRED VALLEY
--------------------
This wonderful tour begins by picking you up from your hotel at 8:30 in the morning to travel to the Sacred Valley. On the way, we stop at Ccorao and Taray, as well as the small town of Pisac, where you will have time to visit the local markets as well as some archaeological sites during a 2 hour guided tour.

From there we continue to the town of Urubamba for a delicious lunch buffet featuring typical regional dishes, then continue on to Ollantaytambo, the famous living Incan town, where we will visit numerous archaeological sites.

Around 19:00, we board the train at Ollantaytambo to go to Aguas Calientes, the gateway to Machu Picchu. There, you will be escorted to your hotel for the night. If interested, there are also optional hot springs at Aguas Calientes.

DAY 2: MACHU PICCHU
-------------------
After a very early breakfast, we will take a bus from Aguas Calientes to the entrance of Machu Picchu. The day will be spent immersing ourselves in the beauty and incomparable perfection of one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. After a 2-hour guided tour, you will have free time to explore the ruins on your own. If you have a ticket, you can also climb the mountain of Huayna Picchu.

Later, we will return by bus to Aguas Calientes, then by train to Ollantaytambo, and finally by bus again to your hotel in Cusco.
