INTRODUCTION
------------
The citadel of Machu Picchu is the most important tourist attraction in Cusco. Now known as one of the "Seven Wonders of the World" and "Naval of the World," it is designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and the most visited destination in Peru. Machu Picchu is known for its extraordinary architecture and views.

ITINERARY
---------
To start our tour of Machu Picchu, you must arrive at least one day before to the city of Cusco. Cusco is located southeast of Peru's capital, Lima, and over 11,000' of elevation. While Machu Picchu can be visited by train or foot (along the ancient Inca Trail in two or four day), for this tour we will use the train for all transportation.

We will pick you up from your hotel in Cusco approximately two hours before your scheduled train departure. After a short ride to the town of Ollantaytambo, we will transfer to train (either Peru Rail or Inca Rail), which will take us to the town of Aguas Calientes. There, your guide will be waiting for you, and he will take you ~30 minutes by bus up to the entrance to Machu Picchu. Welcome to "The Lost City of the Incas."

Once inside, we will begin a guided tour, visiting the Main Plaza, Circular Tower, multiple cemeteries, and other notable locations. All told, the guided tour lasts approximately two hours. Afterward, you will have plenty of free time to explore Machu Picchu on your own before returning to Aguas Calientes to eat dinner. Note that you should pack a lunch to eat while inside the ruins (not provided).

In the evening, we will retrace our steps, taking the train from Aguas Calients to Ollantaytambo, where we will transfer to your bus back to Cusco.
