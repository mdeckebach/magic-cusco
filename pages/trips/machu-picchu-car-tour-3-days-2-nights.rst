INTRODUCTION
------------
This trip is ideal for tourists who do not have much time and want to see Cusco and Machu Picchu while experiencing the region.

DAY 1: CUSCO - CITY TOUR
------------------------
After arriving and being transported to your hotel, take the morning to acclimatize and rest. At 13:30, we will set out on Cusco's City Tour, which includes highlights such as Qoricancha, Santo Domingo Cathedral, Sun Temple, Golden Palace. Thereafter, we will visit three key archaeological sites just outside Cusco: Sacsayhuaman, Pukapukara (Red Fortress), and Tambomachay. Returning to Cusco around 18:30, you will have plenty of time to rest up for the days ahead.

DAY 2: MACHU PICCHU
-------------------
Depending on your train tickets, you will be transported from Cusco to Ollantaytambo station where you will then take a train to the city of Aguas Calientes. Upon arrival, a guided bus will take you from Aguas Calientes directly to the gates of Machu Picchu.

Upon entering the park, you will receive a guided tour of this majestic site for approximately 2 hours, stopping at the Temple of the Three Windows and Solar Clock, among other points of interest. Plenty of time will be left for self-exploration.

When it is time to go, a bus will take you back down to Aguas Calientes at least 30 minutes before your return train's departure time. Taking the train back to Ollantaytambo (approx. 1 hour 45 min trip), you will then transfer to a bus to take you back to your hotel in Cusco.

DAY 3: DEPARTURE

Depending on your flight itinerary, we will get you back to the airport in plenty of time to return home.
