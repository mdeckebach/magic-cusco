Rainbow Mountain, also known as the Seven Color Mountain, is considered by National Geographic as one of the 100 places to visit in your life. This spectacular site is not to be missed!

DAY 1
-----
The adventure begins at 4:30 am with a pickup from your hotel. From there, we drive to the picturesque town of Chirihuani, south of Cusco, where we stop to grab some food and drink for the trip. After this short stop, we wind through the mysterious snow-capped Andeas, passing llamas, alpaca, sheep, and vicuñas as we make our way through the valleys. At approximately 7:30 am, we will stop for a delicious Andean breakfast prepared by our chef.

Returning to our bus, we will continue on to Fula Wasi, the start of our hike. From there, it is approximately 1.5 hours on foot through the Red Valley. As we walk, the path will gradually change in color and in views, until finally we arrive at a height of 5,200 meters and Vinicunca, or Rainbow Mountain.
