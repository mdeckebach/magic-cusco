INTRODUCTION
------------
This is an impressive circuit that includes numerous lagoons, agricultural sites, and the opportunity to bicycle!

This tour starts in Cusco around 8:45 AM, where it sets of for the town of Urubamba. On the way, we will encounter the salt mines of Maras. From above, these mines look like white patches between the multi-colored green pastures of the Sacred Valley and Urubamba mountains. Since the time of the Incas, the families of Maras and Pichingoto have extracted salt from these sites, claiming the salt has medicinal properties.

THE MORAY SALT MINES
--------------------
The Moray Salt Mines are located in a narrow canyon next to the town of Maras. There are approximately 3,000 small salt wells built into the side of the mountain, which are filled every 3 days with the salty water that naturally eminates from the top of the wells. When the water evaporates, the salt solidifies until after about a month the salt is harvested for commerce. 

Nearby in Maras, houses still show stonework and coat of arms symbols from the 16th century. We will pass through the traditional Spanish town of Maras, an obligatory stop for mules on the numerous transportation routes that pass through the area. Despite the mountainous terrain, it is possible to bike from Maras to Urubuma. Travel by horse or foot is also possible along this beautiful route.

GIANT GREENHOUSES
-----------------
About six kilometers from Maras is a masterpiece of agricultural engineering:  circular stone terraces complete with underground irrigation. From above, these gigantic terraces look like the huge eyes of the Pachamama. During the Moray Raymi agricultural festival (held in September annually), dancers, musicians, and other organizations decorate the terraces with flags and colored costumes. Quite a site to see!

These terraces were once an agricultural research center, as the different elevations generated microclimates to allow for up to 20 different types of agriculture. As a result, the Incas were able to domesticate wild plants and species that do not natrually grow in Cusco.
