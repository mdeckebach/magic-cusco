                <h3>About Oscar</h3>
                <p>I was born in Cusco and grew up in the nearby countryside with my grandfather who taught me Quechua (the language of the Peruvian countryside) as a boy. I still hold fond memories from my rural upbringing and a deep respect for the people and land that raised me.</p>
                <p>As a child I worked and studied, attending the National Science College for high school. There I met Radio Angulo, a teacher who taught me many things about the Incas of Cusco. I studied tourism for 3 years, completing an internship at the Inca Museum where I met another mentor:  archaeologist Luis Barreda Murillo. Today I hold my tourism license and provide tourism services through MagicCusco.</p>
                <h3>Charity</h3>
                <p>We pledge to give 10% of all earnings to support mountain children.</p>
