The Incans had a great network of roads that connected the vast territories of their empire. One main road, Qhapag Ñan, featured hanging bridges made from vegetable fibers. One such bridge, Q'eswachaka, has been maintained through the generations for over 500 years and still stands today. It is located on the Apurímac River, some 3,700 meters above sea level, and the last of the Incan Suspension Bridges. Every year, more than 1,000 people from four communities gather to repair and maintain this bridge, an ancestral ritual recognized in 2013 by UNESCO.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
We start our day bright and early at 4:30 am, picking you up from your hotel. After leaving Cusco, our first stop is Combapata, where we will enjoy a continental breakfast in a traditional family home and have some time to stretch our legs.

From there, we pass through the district of Yanaoca until arriving in Q'ewe, where Q'eswachaka is located. We will take our time exploring this 28.67 meter long bridge as well as the surrounding area. Your guide will share not only the history of this area but also our modern understanding of Incan engineering.

After visiting Q'eswachaka, we will return to Combapata for lunch and then take a short walk to a viewpoint of four lakes:  Pampamarca, Asnacqocha, Acopía, and Pomacanchi. Finally, we will return to Cusco, reaching your hotel between 16:30 and 17:00.
